# Networking Secure Protocols

## Overview
Secure protocols ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data in transit.

## Common Secure Protocols
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Encrypts HTTP (resulting in HTTPS), email, and VoIP communications.
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: Provides encrypted command-line access to remote systems.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Creates encrypted tunnels across insecure networks.

## Security Properties
- **Confidentiality**: Prevents eavesdropping.
- **Integrity**: Protects against data tampering.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of communicating parties.

## SOC Analyst Focus
- Monitor encrypted traffic for anomalies (e.g., large data exfiltration via VPN).
- Detect misuse of secure tunnels by adversaries for command-and-control.
