## Deep Dive: Practical Use of MITRE Tools for SOC Analysts

This document provides an in-depth explanation of how to use the MITRE ecosystem effectively as a SOC Level 1 Analyst or Blue Team member. It covers eight core components commonly introduced in the MITRE TryHackMe room, but here we focus on real-world application, correlation, and defensive insight.

1. MITRE ATT&CK Framework

MITRE ATT&CK is a comprehensive, curated knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques observed in the wild.

Practical Usage in SOC:

Alert Enrichment: When a suspicious PowerShell command is detected, map it to ATT&CK Technique T1059.001. This gives context to the SOC team.

Threat Hunting: You might proactively search for techniques like T1087 (Account Discovery) to detect internal recon.

Playbook Building: Incidents tagged with ATT&CK techniques help standardize triage steps and escalation.

Gap Analysis: By checking what tactics/techniques are not covered by your SIEM, you can improve visibility and detection.

2. MITRE CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository)

CAR provides detection logic and analytics tied directly to ATT&CK techniques.

Practical Usage in SOC:

SIEM Rule Development: Use CAR pseudocode to translate into SPL (for Splunk) or KQL (for Sentinel).

Analyst Verification: Cross-check what event IDs or logs are required to detect T1543.003 (Windows Service Creation).

Improving Detection Coverage: If an alert uses a general rule, CAR helps you fine-tune with precise detection logic.

3. MITRE D3FEND

D3FEND is a complementary framework to ATT&CK. While ATT&CK describes attacker behavior, D3FEND catalogs defensive techniques and mitigations.

Practical Usage in SOC:

Justifying Controls: When suggesting EDR logging or registry monitoring, link to D3FEND technique D3-RE (Registry Key Monitoring).

Building Defense-in-Depth: Map known attacker paths to potential countermeasures from D3FEND.

Incident Response: Recommend targeted D3FEND controls post-incident to plug the gaps.

4. MITRE Engage

MITRE Engage is a model for Active Defense. It focuses on deception, adversary engagement, and controlled intelligence gathering.

Practical Usage in SOC:

Honeypots and Honeytokens: Plant decoy credentials or machines and monitor interactions.

Adversary Analysis: Let controlled access persist to observe behavior and develop behavioral signatures.

Risk-Based Traps: If you know certain endpoints are always targeted, reinforce them with additional telemetry and deception layers.

5. ATT&CK Emulation Plans

These are detailed blueprints to simulate adversary behavior in a controlled environment, often used in purple teaming.

Practical Usage in SOC:

- Defensive Validation: Run emulation plans and verify whether your SIEM/EDR detects every step.

- Alert Testing: Test SOC rules and alerts against known APT behaviors (e.g. APT3, FIN6).

- Incident Reproduction: Emulate past incidents to validate new detection or response procedures.

6. ATT&CK & Threat Intelligence

Mapping TTPs from threat reports (e.g. from Mandiant, Recorded Future) to ATT&CK techniques helps contextualize threats.

Practical Usage in SOC:

- IOC Enrichment: A malicious IP from a phishing campaign can be tied to T1566 (Phishing) and T1059 (Command Scripting).

- Campaign Correlation: If your org is seeing indicators from APT29, map techniques to known TTPs.

Prioritization: Use ATT&CK mappings to assess which threats align with your org's critical assets.

7. Basic Terminology

Understanding tactics, techniques, sub-techniques, and procedures (TTPs) is foundational.

Practical Usage in SOC:

- Clear Communication: Escalations tagged with ATT&CK technique IDs improve communication between tiers.

- Consistent Reporting: Uniform terminology allows better documentation, auditing, and sharing with external partners.

8. MITRE Overview

MITRE as an organization supports multiple government and civilian sectors by publishing vendor-agnostic tools and models.

Why SOC Should Care:

- Frameworks are open-source and industry-recognized.

- MITRE models (ATT&CK, D3FEND, Engage) provide a universal language for Blue/Red/Purple teaming.

- Increasingly integrated into SIEMs, EDRs, and Threat Intelligence Platforms.

## Final Notes for SOC Level 1 Analysts

- Learn to map every incident or alert to ATT&CK where possible.

- Use CAR as your detection playbook.

- Refer to D3FEND when asked, "How can we stop this?"

- Think in terms of relationships, behaviors, and signatures, not just IOCs.
