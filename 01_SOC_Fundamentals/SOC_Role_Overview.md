## What is a SOC?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team responsible for monitoring, detecting, responding to, and preventing cybersecurity threats across an organization’s IT infrastructure.

SOC teams operate 24/7 and are often structured in levels (L1, L2, L3) based on expertise and responsibilities.
